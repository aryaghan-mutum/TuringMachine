##### Overview of Automatic Computing Machine (ACM):

This project is based on Alan Turing’s groundbreaking mathematics paper: [On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem](hhttps://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf)
which is a fundamental model of computing

- Here in the title: 'Computable Numbers' are real numbers.
- Einsidungproblem is  a german word for Decision problem

Turing Machine which is now popular but Turing named it as Automatic Computing Machine. ACM wasn't a real machine implemented with mechanics, or electronics, but a mental model of computation that Turing created to reason about and demonstrate the computation of real numbers.

Turing’s ACM also provides a benchmark for the computational capabilities of any computer to this day and also a model of what we think of as a computer.


ACM has four components:

Paper tape (paper tapes are broken up into squares. Each square can only hold a single symbol. For example: 0 or 1 or a letter)

Printer:
prints a single symbol in the square
prints a blank n the square (blank means erasing a symbol)
prints 0 or 1 n the square

Note: this printer doesn’t deride an existing symbol with another symbol

Scanner: used to observe what is in the square the printer scanner is on


The ACM always makes a decision about what to do based on the symbol in the square the printer scanner is on.

Directions: State of Mind
